# 🌐 My First Web Page – HTML Learning Project

Welcome to my **HTML learning project**, based on a hands-on tutorial I followed on YouTube. This project is a reflection of what I’ve learned about building web pages using HTML5, and it’s my very first step into the world of web development!

## 📚 What This Project Includes

This HTML page showcases a variety of fundamental and advanced HTML5 elements and features. It’s not just a webpage — it's a summary of the concepts I’ve mastered so far.

### 🔧 Features I’ve Implemented

- **Basic HTML Document Structure**
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
  - Meta tags for character encoding, author, viewport settings, and descriptions
  - Custom favicon and linked CSS file

- **Page Layout and Navigation**
  - Semantic elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`
  - Anchor links for internal navigation
  - Accessible labeling with `aria-label`

- **Text Content and Formatting**
  - Headings: `<h1>` to `<h3>`
  - Paragraphs, emphasized (`<em>`) and strong (`<strong>`) text
  - Lists: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<dl>` with proper structure

- **Images and Multimedia**
  - `<img>` with attributes like `alt`, `title`, `width`, `height`, and `loading`
  - `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for annotated visuals

- **Tables**
  - Fully structured table with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`
  - Scope attributes and time-specific data formatting

- **Forms and Inputs**
  - Multiple input types: text, number, password, radio, checkbox, select (including `optgroup`)
  - Use of `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for logical grouping
  - Placeholder, pattern matching, required fields, and form action methods

- **Interactive Elements**
  - `<details>` and `<summary>` for collapsible sections
  - Time formatting with `<time datetime="">`
  - `<abbr>` for accessible abbreviations

- **Accessibility and Best Practices**
  - Use of descriptive labels and attributes
  - Consistent structure and semantic markup
  - Clean and readable code with comments and indentation

## 🌴 Bonus: Vacation Planning Section

To make learning fun, I included a section where I dream about my next vacation destination, complete with images and address formatting using the `<address>` tag. It’s a playful way to integrate real-world scenarios into my learning.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to build a complete HTML document from scratch
- The importance of semantic tags and structure
- Creating accessible, interactive, and user-friendly content
- The foundation to eventually integrate CSS and JavaScript
